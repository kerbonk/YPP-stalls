How to use:

Edit commodity prices in the "Show all commodities" window.
Make sure to save, this will also update craft prices. Also if you accidently mess up the format then close the whole thing without saving and reopen.
Same with managing labor.

Craft cost assumes you got all your ingredients for the 'buy' price, or crafted it at your own stall if you own it.
Profit assumes you sell for the 'sell' price.
Quick profit assumes you sell for the 'buy' price.

Profit per hour window ranks the amount of poes you will make for crafting things per hour of labor spent on it. The quick suffix means you sell for the 'buy' price, otherwise it assumes you sell for the 'sell' price.
