# YPP-stalls

Edit commodity prices in the "Show all commodities" window.
Make sure to save, this will also update craft prices.
Same with managing labor.

Craft cost assumes you got all your ingredients for the 'buy' price, or crafted it at your own stall if you own it.
Profit assumes you sell for the 'sell' price.
Quick profit assumes you sell for the 'buy' price.

Profit per hour window ranks the amount of poes you will make for crafting things. The quick suffix suggests you sell for the 'buy' price.
